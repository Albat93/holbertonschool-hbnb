## Description
The Package Diagram illustrates the architectural organization of the HBnB system, breaking it into key packages that manage different functionalities.

## Main Packages and Their Responsibilities
- **Client Package**: The front-end interface used by users to interact with the system.
- **API Package**: Handles communication between the client and the business logic layer.
- **Business Logic Package**: Contains core functionalities for processing requests and enforcing business rules.
- **Data Access Package**: Manages interactions with the database to retrieve and store information.
- **Database Package**: Stores all application data, including users, places, reviews, and amenities.

## Design Rationale
- The layered architecture ensures separation of concerns, making it easy to scale and maintain.
- The Fa√ßade pattern is implemented in the API package to simplify external interactions with the system.

# 3. Detailed Explanation of Packages

## Client Package
- **Description**:
  - The user-facing interface that allows users to interact with HBnB.
  - Communicates with the API to send requests and display data.

## API Package
- **Description**:
  - Acts as an intermediary between the client and the business logic.
  - Processes incoming HTTP requests and routes them to the appropriate business logic functions.

## Business Logic Package
- **Description**:
  - Implements the core application logic, such as user authentication, place creation, and review management.
  - Ensures data consistency and enforces business rules.

## Data Access Package
- **Description**:
  - Handles interactions with the database.
  - Converts business logic requests into database queries and returns structured data.

## Database Package
- **Description**:
  - Stores persistent data, including user accounts, places, amenities, and reviews.
  - Ensures efficient retrieval and storage of data for system operations.

# 4. Structure and Design Integrity

- **Separation of Concerns**: Each package has a well-defined role to ensure modularity.
- **Scalability**: The system can easily be extended by adding new modules to the business logic or API layers.
- **Security**: The API package serves as a controlled access point preventing direct interaction with the database.
